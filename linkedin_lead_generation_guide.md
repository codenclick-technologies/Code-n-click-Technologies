### Wednesday: Industry Opinion/Hot Take

Unpopular opinion:

[Controversial but true statement]

Everyone is doing [trend/practice] wrong. Here's why:

❌ [Common mistake 2]
❌ [Common mistake 3]

✅ Here's what works instead:
[Your better approach]

Agree or disagree? 👇

#[Industry] #[Topic]
```

**Example**:
```
Unpopular opinion:

Your website redesign won't fix your business problems.

I've seen too many companies spend $50k+ on a "beautiful" website that generates ZERO ROI.

Here's what they missed:
❌ No conversion optimization
❌ No clear value proposition
❌ No user testing
❌ Just focused on "looking good"

✅ What actually works:
→ Design based on user behavior data
→ A/B test everything
→ Optimize for ONE clear goal
→ Measure success by conversions, not aesthetics

A $5k website that converts at 5% > A $50k website that converts at 0.5%

Agree or disagree? 👇

Aapko appear hona chahiye!

   - Marketing managers
   - Product managers
   - CEOs of target companies

2. **Personalize Message**:
```

Best,
Lokender
```

❌ "Hi, let's connect"
❌ Generic sales pitch
```

What's been your biggest learning from user testing?
