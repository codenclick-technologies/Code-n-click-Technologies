## 3️⃣ Lead Conversion Framework

### The Consultative Sales Process

#### Step 1: Discovery Call (30 min)
**Goal**: Understand their business, not sell immediately

**Questions to Ask**:
1. "What's your biggest business challenge right now?"
2. "What have you tried before that didn't work?"
3. "If we solve [problem], what does that mean for your business?"
4. "What's the cost of NOT solving this?"
5. "What's your timeline and budget range?"

**DON'T**: Talk about your services yet
**DO**: Take extensive notes, ask follow-ups

#### Step 2: Proposal (48-hour turnaround)
**Include**:
1. **Their Problem** (in their words)
2. **Your Solution** (specific to them)
3. **Timeline** (with milestones)
4. **Investment** (broken down by phase)
5. **Case Study** (similar project you've done)
6. **Guarantee** (risk reversal)

**Pro Tip**: Send a personalized video explaining the proposal

#### Step 3: Presentation Call (45 min)
**Structure**:
- First 10 min: Recap their problem
- Next 20 min: Walk through solution
- Next 10 min: Handle objections
- Last 5 min: Close or next steps

**Common Objections & Responses**:

**"The price is too high"**
→ "I understand. Let me ask - what's the ROI you're expecting? If we hit a 10x return, would the investment make sense?"

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "Of course. What specific concerns do you have? Let's address them now while I have you."

**"Can you lower the price?"**
→ "I can adjust the scope. Which features are most critical to achieve [their goal]?"

### Conversion-Boosting Tactics

#### A) Social Proof System
- Get video testimonials from every happy client
- Feature 3-5 testimonials on every service page
- Create a "Wall of Love" page with 50+ testimonials
- Use specific results: "Increased leads by 247%" not "Great to work with"

#### B) Risk Reversal Offers
**Option 1**: 30-day money-back guarantee
**Option 2**: Performance-based payment (20% upfront, 80% on delivery)
**Option 3**: "Pay what you want" pilot project (for big potential clients)

#### C) Urgency & Scarcity
- "We only take 3 new clients per month"
- "Book this month and get [bonus] free"
- "Limited slots for this quarter"

**NOTE**: Only use if TRUE. Never fake scarcity.
